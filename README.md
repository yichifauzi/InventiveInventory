Experience seamless inventory management in Minecraft with Inventive Inventory, your one-stop solution for sorting, auto-refilling, profiles and slot-locking.

**⚙️ -> Configurable Option**

## Features 🚀💡
### Sorting 🔀🔠
There's a mess in your inventory? No problem, a simple key press (Default: R)⚙️ will it get organized.

The sorting function is aware of the cursor’s position.  
This means that if you’re in a container and hover over your inventory, the inventory will be sorted instead of the container.  
In all other scenarios, the container will be sorted.

By pressing the Advanced Operation Key you can keep your cursor stack while sorting. ⚙️
> This feature is compatible with all types of containers.

### Locked Slots 🔒🚫
You can lock slots in your inventory by holding the Advanced Operation Key (Default: Alt) and clicking on the slot.  
Items in such a slot will not be affected by sorting, automatic refilling or profile loading. ⚙️ (for every feature seperatley)

Additionally, picked-up items won't be placed in such a slot either and will rather get dropped.  
(In singleplayer this works even with quick-moving items, on servers quick-move preventing is currently not available)

### Profiles 📋📂
Save your current hotbar and offhand state and load it anytime back.
